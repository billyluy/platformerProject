> An android game about a trapped mushroom trying to get out. 
> Black holes are check points, coins allow you to double jump, the goal is to get to the end before rage quitting!

On the phone, you would press the buttons to move around but on the pc emulator, we were able to use arrow keys to maneuver the mushroom.
